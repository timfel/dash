The  year  is  2034  and  the  machines  
have  won. In a final,  desperate  act  
mankind  has  chosen to bestow its combined  
knowledge  and technology unto the most 
humble of creatures: the GIRAFFE.

Equipped  with the  knowledge  of man,  
a rocket-fueled broomstick,  and a 
foresight as only such  a large  mammal  
can have,  all hope rests on you to
escape the clutches of the new robot 
overlords  to start  a  new,  peaceful,  
and  decidedly  vegetarian
kind of civilization.

Preferably far from lions, too.
